    | New Relic configuration for Laravel applications
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | Please consult the docs before configuring, especially if you already
    | have data for this application in your New Relic account. This package
    | makes some opinionated choices about naming conventions and filtering,
    | which vary from how New Relic reports Laravel transactions normally.
    | It attempts to normalise transaction names in a more consistent
    | Laravel-style format. Links to docs and guidance is provided below:
    |
    |       Package:   https://github.com/JackWH/laravel-new-relic/README.md
    |     New Relic:   https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/php-agent/
    |
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | Set up some basic details about your New Relic installation.
    |
    | app_name: This will be determined automatically from the New Relic agent,
    |           but you can customise if you need to. Note that doing so will
    |           change the APM name for Laravel requests in New Relic's UI.
    |
    | api_key:  Optional, but required to use the New Relic deployments feature.
    |

    'app_name'     => ini_get('newrelic.appname') ?: env('APP_NAME', 'laravel'),

    /*
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | Environments
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | environments: Set which environments you'd expect New Relic to be
    |               installed in. The package will only run in these
    |               environments.
    |
    | loggable:     When testing this package in one of these environments,
    |               we can bootstrap the New Relic functions, and write logs
    |               indicating what would be happening instead. Useful for
    |               ensuring this package is set up properly before deploying.
    |               Comment out 'local' after testing to avoid excessive logging.

    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | HTTP Requests
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | middleware: For HTTP requests, we'll apply the package NewRelicMiddleware
    |             to create transactions in New Relic. If you want to customise
    |             the default middleware, extend it and provide your custom
    |             classname. Middleware will be applied automatically, but you
    |             may want to set its priority in app/Http/Kernel.php's
    |             $middlewarePriory array, to apply it as early in the stack
    |             as possible. If you want to capture user attributes, it
    |             must come *after* \Illuminate\Auth\Middleware\Authorize.
    |
    | visitors:   If 'record_user_id' is true, we'll save the user's ID in the
    |             transaction. If no user is logged in, the transaction will
    |             show with as "Guest" (or your preferred 'guest_label'). Set
    |             guest_label to null if you don't want to report this. You
    |             can also optionally log the visitor's IP address too.
    |
    | rewrite:    Specify any paths which should be given a custom transaction
    |             name in New Relic. This is useful for when you have a route
    |             which doesn't have a name (for example, in a third-party
    |             package), and want to name it consistently without falling
    |             back to the full controller class and action (see below).
    |
    | prefix:     HTTP transactions will be identified in New Relic by the name
    |             of their route, or if the route doesn't have a name, by their
    |             controller action. Here you can also specify an optional
    |             prefix to identify HTTP requests. For example, "Route " would
    |             label HTTP requests in New Relic as "Route admin.dashboard".
    |
    | ignore:     Set which HTTP requests should be ignored by New Relic.
